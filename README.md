Luis Rocha Photography
========
I previously hosted my photography portfolio on Squarespace, but seeing as how I'm a web developer now it seemed like a cardinal sin to not showcase my photos on a page I made from scratch! I wanted to create a modern, minimalistic page that showed off my best work in an easy to use and aeshtetically pleasing page.

Using Isotope, I was able to provide an essay way to view all photos in my portfolio as well as sort them by category. This is all done within a cascading grid layout powered by Masonry. 

In order to keep things looking fresh , I created a function that shuffles around the order of my images on each visit.  

The site is mobile optimized featuring a slide out side menu for small and largee sized devices.
